# Awesome UUID

A UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) is a 128-bit identifier designed to be globally unique without requiring a central authority. It comes in several versions, including UUIDv1 (timestamp + MAC address), UUIDv4 (random), and newer ones like UUIDv7 (time-ordered + random). UUIDs are commonly used as primary keys in databases, identifiers for sessions, API tokens, and in distributed systems to ensure uniqueness across services. Each version serves different needsâ€”some prioritize uniqueness, others sortability or privacy. Their consistent format makes UUIDs a reliable choice across platforms and programming languages.
